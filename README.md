# What is Data Structure?

In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

In Data Structure, there are several subtopics I learned:
1. Array of Record
2. Pointer
3. Singly Linked List
4. Doubly Linked List
5. Stack
6. Queue
7. Multilist
8. Tree

I used C++ language for this study.
